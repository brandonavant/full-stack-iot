# Source Code

The source code for this project is split into two different code bases:

- lambda: This directory houses the code related to the back-end lambda functions, which process the Alexa Skill requests.
- rpi: This directory houses the source code that is meant to be run on the Raspberry Pi. This code is what drives the changing of the RGB LED.
